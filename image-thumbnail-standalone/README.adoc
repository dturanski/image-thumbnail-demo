= Thumbnail Standalone

This demonstrates the use of the Spring https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/functions/function/http-request-function[HttpRequestProcessor function]
in a standalone Spring Boot Application

The app downloads some images from https://imgur.com and uses the link:../image-thumbnail-processor/src/main/java/io/spring/example/image/thumbnail/processor/ThumbnailProcessor.java[ThumbnailProcessor] to create a thumbnail for each image.

== Run

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
