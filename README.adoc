= Thumbnail Creation Demo

This demonstrates the use of the Spring https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/functions/function/http-request-function[HttpRequestProcessor function]
in a standalone Spring Boot Application.

The app downloads some images from https://imgur.com and creates a thumbnail of each one.

== Run

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
